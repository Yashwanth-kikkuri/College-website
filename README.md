# College-website

my team and I did this project to implement the concepts that we have learnt in our college . We chose this topic so that we can resolve the issues in our college website and also added few student requirement features in it by discussing among us and seniors.

The languages we used in our project were:
 *  HTML
 *  CSS
 *  JavaScript
 *  PHP
 *  MySQL
 *  Bootstrap   
 *  JSON
Note: The last two were not much used in it.

The languages that I know are:
 *  HTML
 *  CSS
 *  JavaScript
 *  PHP
 *  MySQL
 *  Python
 *  Angular JS
 *  Java
Note: I am just a beginner in Java and Angular JS
