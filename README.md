# College-website

My team and I, have made a project of creating our college website. The main aim of this project is to come out with a more user friendly site by displaying all the practical requirements of students, which we came to know by discussing with our seniors & classmates.

For this project we have used the following languages:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
PHP
MySQL
Bootstrap
JSON       (Note: The last two were not much used in it.)
Further along with the above languages I am also more familiarised with Python, Angular JS and Java Note, where in I am just a beginner with last two languages.


The languages we used in our project were:
 *  HTML
